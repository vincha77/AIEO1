# Build 🏗️

In today's assignment, we'll be creating modern web applications using AI-powered development tools and deploying them to production.

- 🤝 [Breakout Room](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/AIEO1-Staging/blob/main/Session_02_Front_End_UI_Development_%26_Deployment_of_LLM_Applications/BreakoutRoom.md)
    - Set up Cursor with GitFlow rules and personal coding styles
    - Create a frontend application using v0.dev
    - Download, customize, and run the app locally
    - Push to GitHub and deploy to Vercel

- 🤝 [Assignment](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/AIEO1-Staging/blob/main/Session_02_Front_End_UI_Development_%26_Deployment_of_LLM_Applications/Assignment.md)
    - Implement multi-agent workflow using feature branches
    - Work on multiple features simultaneously
    - Practice GitFlow merging strategies
    - Deploy updates through CI/CD pipeline

# Ship 🚢

The completed frontend application deployed to Vercel with multiple features merged from different branches!

<details>
<summary>🚧 Advanced Build 🚧 (OPTIONAL - <i>open this section for the requirements</i>)</summary>

**Build a Fully Functional Frontend App:**
- Try to create a functioning app with interactive features
- Challenge yourself to build features that work entirely in the frontend
- See how far you can get without needing any backend Python scripts
- Explore what's possible with client-side JavaScript, React state management, and browser APIs

**Tip:** Think about apps that can work with local storage, browser APIs, or client-side data processing. Examples: calculators, todo lists, form builders, interactive dashboards, or data visualization tools.

```
🚀 Exciting News! 🚀

I am thrilled to announce that I have just built and deployed a modern web application using AI-powered development tools! 🎉🤖

🔍 Three Key Takeaways:

1️⃣ AI tools like v0.dev can generate complete frontend applications from natural language prompts

2️⃣ GitFlow and feature branching enable parallel development workflows

3️⃣ Modern CI/CD with Vercel makes deployment seamless and automatic

Let's continue pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the world of AI-assisted development. Here's to many more innovations! 🚀
