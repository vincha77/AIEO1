This cooling effect can help to bring inflation down by decreasing demand for goods and services.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Expectations of Future Inflation**: Central banks also consider inflation expectations, which are influenced by current inflation rates, past inflation trends, and economic forecasts. If consumers and businesses expect high inflation to persist, central banks may raise interest rates preemptively to anchor those expectations and prevent a self-fulfilling cycle of rising prices.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Real vs. Nominal Interest Rates**: The real interest rate is the nominal interest rate (the stated rate) adjusted for inflation. If inflation is high while nominal rates remain unchanged, the real interest rate declines, which can incentivize borrowing and spending, potentially exacerbating inflation. Central banks aim to maintain positive real interest rates to support price stability.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Impact on Investment and Savings**: High inflation can erode the purchasing power of money, affecting savings. In response, consumers and investors might seek higher nominal returns, leading to demands for higher interest rates. Conversely, if inflation is low, the urgency for higher returns diminishes, allowing for lower interest rates that can stimulate borrowing and investment.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Yield Curve Considerations**: In an environment of rising inflation and increasing short-term interest rates, the yield curve (which plots interest rates across different maturities) might steepen. This can influence decisions on long-term investments, as investors may require higher long-term rates to compensate for expected inflation risk.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. **Financial Markets**: Inflation influences broader financial market dynamics, including bond yields and stock prices. Typically, as inflation rises, bond yields increase (and prices fall) as investors demand higher compensation for inflation risk, which can affect overall interest rate environments.\n",
            "\n",
            "In summary, inflation is a critical determinant of interest rate decisions. Central banks monitor inflation closely, and their policies are designed to strike a balance between fostering economic growth and controlling inflation to protect the economy’s overall health.\n"

              "### Step 1: Define Key Terms\n",

              "\n",

              "2. **Reduction in Inflationary Pressure:** Lower aggregate demand can help to slow down price increases. This is the goal of the central bank's actions, as it seeks to bring inflation down from 5%.\n",
              "\n",
              "3. **Effect on Wages:** As demand for labor may decrease due to reduced economic activity, employers might hold back on wage increases or even consider layoffs, putting downward pressure on nominal wage growth.\n",
              "\n",
              "### Step 4: Real Wage Effect\n",
              "Due to the relationship between inflation, nominal wages, and real wages, we can summarize the effect on real wages as follows:\n",
              "\n",
              "- **With Inflation at 5% and Nominal Wage Growth at 3%:** Initially, real wages are decreasing because inflation is higher than nominal wage growth. This indicates that workers' purchasing power is falling.\n",
              "  \n",
              "- **With Higher Interest Rates and Potential Lower Nominal Wage Growth:** If nominal wage growth slows further as the economy cools due to tighter monetary policy, real wages will continue to contract or may even fall further, perpetuating the decline in purchasing power.\n",
              "\n",
              "### Conclusion\n",
              "In summary, as the central bank raises interest rates to combat 5% inflation while nominal wage growth sits at 3%, real wages likely decrease, pointing to a drop in workers' purchasing power. If this monetary policy leads to a reduction in economic activity and further slows nominal wage growth, the real wage effect may result in a continued decline in the real standard of living for workers."

This reduction in real wages means that even if nominal wages increase, the higher cost of goods and services can result in employees effectively earning less than before, impacting their standard of living.

        "- **Few-shot prompts** improve structure and reasoning consistency.  \n",
        "- **Reasoning models** (like GPT-5-reasoning) deliver more coherent causal explanations between inflation, interest rates, and growth indicators.  \n",
        "- **Non-reasoning models** (e.g., GPT-5-mini) provide faster, surface-level insights ideal for retrieval or summarization tasks.  \n",
        "- Future work could add **RAG pipelines** with real-time macroeconomic data or integrate with financial dashboards for live LLM reasoning visualization."
