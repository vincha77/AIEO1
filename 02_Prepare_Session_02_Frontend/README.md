# **🖼️ Session 2 Overview: Frontend Development**

In this session, we’ll dig into how to vibe code front ends so that they are manageable and likely to succeed. **While *it is true that simply vibe coding a frontend in one shot is trivial, especially with an app like [v0](https://v0.app/),* there is more to building out and managing a frontend as features are added and the application evolves. For this, we need to learn how to build in fast iteration cycles to our integration, testing, and deployment of code changes.

## 📛 Required **Tooling & Account Setup**

1. 🧑‍💻 Ensure [Cursor](https://cursor.com/) is installed and [GitHub](https://github.com/) is set up.
2. 🚀 Create a [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) account (free tier).
3. 💻 Install the Vercel CLI in Cursor: `npm install -g vercel`
4. 🖼️ Install Node.js on your computer 
    1. Mac: `brew install node`
    2. Windows: `sudo apt install nodejs npm`

## 🧑‍💻 Recommended Pre-Work!

1. 📚 Read:
    1. [What you need to know about Vibe Coding](https://vercel.com/blog/what-you-need-to-know-about-vibe-coding), by Vercel (Sep 2025)
    2. [State of Vibe Coding Report](https://v0.app/vibecoding), by Vercel (Sep 2025)

## **🤔 Concepts**

We will build on the core concepts from Session 1, including [Git Branching](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell), [Working with Remotes](https://git-scm.com/book/ms/v2/Git-Basics-Working-with-Remotes), and [Cursor Rules](https://cursor.com/docs/context/rules).

And while we will be using a frontend framework, we want you to focus your attention on backend processes at play here, including:

1. Using multi-agent workflows for parallelization of code generation, or [Embracing the parallel coding agent lifestyle](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/5/parallel-coding-agents/) (October 2025)
2. [The Application Release Process](https://www.techworld-with-nana.com/post/what-is-devops#:~:text=the%20very%20beginning!-,Application%20Release%20Process,-Whenever%20we%27re%20developing) that forms the basis of DevOps and Continuous Integration / [Continuous Delivery](https://www.notion.so/00_Prepare_Session_02_Frontend-2a4cd547af3d80ecaf57db90d258fd6f?pvs=21) (CI/CD) (and [Continuous Security](https://www.notion.so/00_Prepare_Session_02_Frontend-2a4cd547af3d80ecaf57db90d258fd6f?pvs=21)!) Pipelines (Classics)

## ⌨️ **Code**

The **code** for this session flows directly from these core concepts, and includes:

1. Using a professional GitFlow for version control
2. AI-Assisted branch development using custom [Cursor Rules](https://cursor.com/docs/context/rules)
3. Vibe-coding frontend applications from natural language prompts using [v0.app](https://v0.app/)
4. Multi-agent parallelized code development of frontend applications
5. How to manage full CI/CD deployment pipelines that allow you to push to GitHub and deploy live production applications directly
